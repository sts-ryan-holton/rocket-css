# Rocket CSS

### Rocket CSS is an open source, lightweight CSS framework built using Flexbox.

Rocket CSS is a small, lightweight CSS-only framework that allows you to quickly build web applications without the hassle of remembering 1,000s of classes. Unlike other CSS frameworks like Twitter Bootstrap, Rocket CSS comes with a handful of simple components which are all prefixed with the class `.rkt-` which makes it easier to integrate Rocket CSS into an existing site.
